    <h4>Libby - 19090680</h4>
    <p class="pageText">For my team’s usability evaluation we decided to do a usability study of an Apple TV remote. We wanted to study this remote as some of us owned one and we had heard there were some issues with it. We conducted the study using an exploratory style, where we let the user interact with the device freely. We didn’t want to influence the participant’s interaction or opinion on the device as we just wanted to discover any issues with usability. We followed Carter’s methodology of just letting the user use the device with no instruction to see how they might interact with it in the real world and get realistic usability feedback (Carter 2007). I have done usability studies before as a part of my studies during a Digital Design diploma but previously I would give user’s specific tasks to complete. I think giving the users some tasks to complete does have some value when you want to test specific parts of a system or device but using an exploratory unstructured style of study allows the user to test the usability of something in a way that is realistic for them. It allowed us to find issues that we might not have thought about, like the issue of the TV icon (menu) button being confusing. If we had asked the users to just use the remote to find a TV show and watch it we might not have noticed that the TV icon is an issue as this button is not really related to watching TV shows.</p>
    <p class="pageText">We all had an equal role in the study as we decided to all take observations during the study so that we could compare and contrast our notes to make sure that all the issues were discovered. One person could notice an issue that others didn’t for example if they had a better view of the participant’s hand on the remote or if they are better at reading emotions. To conduct the study we briefly explained to the participant that they would use the device for five minutes and we would be watching and taking notes. Then we got the participant to sign the consent form, set a timer and told them to start using the device.</p>
    <p class="pageText">This usability study will impact my thinking and process when creating products in the future. I am completing a Bachelor of Computer Science majoring in Software Development. In my future career I will be working on software applications that will be used by many different users. Although it is unlikely I will have to conduct a usability study again, I may receive the results of a study like this so that I can implement changes to a software. From this usability study and also this Applied Human Computer Interaction paper I have learnt that you need to consider many different aspects when looking at the usability of a device or software including the culture, age and ability of a user, the environment they will use it in and what tasks they would want to complete with it. Developers often forget to think from a user perspective when creating a product which results in a product that is not very usable. Usability is an important but overlooked part of the software industry as even if a software is really well coded and provides very useful features, if it is not usable then people will not want to use it. Usability can directly impact the success of a product and impact the number of active users, the satisfaction of users and profits.</p>
    <p class="pageText">I learnt the process of conducting an exploratory study by reading Phil Carter’s ‘Liberating usability testing’ (Carter 2007) and through lectures in the Applied Human Computer Interaction course. I took notes during lectures so I could remember key points and discussed with the team how we should conduct our study. I can apply this learning technique of reading the literature while writing notes and then discussing with other people to learn other processes. This technique means you are repeating the content and explaining some concepts to other people so that you remember the information longer term. If I were to do a usability study again I would set up the participant so that I could see their hand on the device better which could give more insight on the usability. I also feel like as a team we could’ve been better at not answering the participant’s questions as some of our answers may have given the user some direction but we were trying to take an exploratory approach where we let the user lead the study.</p>

    <p class="pageText">For our usability evaluation assignment my team and I chose to conduct exploratory usability testing of the Apple TV remote. We chose the Apple TV remote 2nd generation remote released in 2022. Reviews for the remote tend to be positive when compared to its previous designs. But we noticed reviews still indicated the remote has usability issues and that the positive praise was only due to the new remote not having features customers didn’t like from the previous version. This led us to wonder what further could be done to the new design to improve its usability.</p>
    <p class="pageText">We chose an explorative test as we wanted to let users freely explore and use the device like they might in their everyday life as outlined in Carter’s methodology. As a team we all had equal participation in the testing and assignment in general. Prior to the actual user exploratory testing we meet as a team several times to discuss ideas and refine. We also met with Robert as a team online to get his feedback and further refine our idea. During exploratory testing we met on campus and recruited random participants. Each team member took their own notes and observations during the 5-minute explorative test and post the study we compared and discussed our findings as a team.</p>
    <p class="pageText">Prior to this paper I had not conducted any usability studies myself. I had analysed data for usability studies in a previous role. But as I was just analysing the data to provide an overview of the feedback I did not provide or create recommendations on the data. I found the explorative usability testing process interesting especially when it came to recording the user feedback and observing the user. It was interesting to me to see how people reacted differently to the same device, and similarities between what people would say either positively or negatively. It made me also see how one’s own bias can influence a study you might be conducting, and that making the testing unbiased is important especially when you are wanting to find issues and create recommendations.</p>
    <p class="pageText">I think this class (Applied Human Computer Interaction) and the usability assignment have taught me useful skills and information which I will be able to take into my professional work, post my study at AUT as a Bachelor of Computer and Information Technology in Software Development student. In order to create good software for users’ developers need to understand what good and bad usability is and develop software with the aim to be easy to understand and use. I think it is probably easy for developers and companies to write off users’ negative feedback as complaining and think that any software or hardware they built is perfect. But this is not correct as usability is very important to users and if something is painful or annoying to a user then they will not want to interact with it, impacting the success of any product you create. By considering user perspective and impact during development, costly development changes can be avoided post deploying. When I develop software in the future, I will be sure to remember this and voice my thoughts on what will provide good usability in whatever team I work with. I will base these thoughts off the information I have learned from my studies and from Applied Human Computer Interaction.</p>

    <p class="pageText">This usability study was the first time that I personally have conducted a usability study in my academic career. Initially when being told that we are conducting a usability study I questioned what a usability study is and why we conduct usability studies. According to Carter, (2007) Usability testing is an investigation into how well an item works while it is really being used. Simply said, they relate to their own thoughts and experiences at the moment they are using the product, from the user's perspective. Knowing this I was able to figure out why we conduct usability studies. We conduct usability studies to figure out how a device/software will be used and interpreted by an average person. Even previously developing software for other courses, even though I thought they were designed well had I conducted a usability study on those pieces of software I would have been able to find multiple pain points by having multiple pairs of eyes looking over it. </p>
    <p class="pageText">For our study we decided to conduct a usability study on the Apple Tv remote. I decided to suggest this device because even though it has been developed by a trillion-dollar company, in its most recent reviews of the new model, I had read and watched that there was a lot of people saying that even though the new model was better than the previous generation it was still cumbersome to understand and use. These reviewers were people with technological backgrounds, so I wanted to test the device on the average person. Following on from this and suggesting the device to the team and reasons for conducting the study they all agreed. </p>
    <p class="pageText">The type of usability study we decided to conduct was an exploratory usability study. I agreed with this type of study because I felt it gave us the best chance of getting some real data that would help us understand where we can improve the remote for the next generation. An exploratory usability study is where you conduct a usability study that is very open ended and is where you get participants to use the device as they normally would and speak aloud what they are thinking and feeling as they are using the device. During this time you are taking notes of not only what they are sarong you are also noting down any specific body language. My involvement in this study was to help recruit participants, take observation notes, and help develop the method. I also helped in forming the recommendations for the next generation based on what notes I had personally taken.</p>
    <p class="pageText">I learned several things while undertaking this study, Firstly it is very hard to recruit people for a study; Secondly that it is very difficult to develop a product that a general population will all in agreeance like. Also that there were aspects that people didn’t like, on the other hand some people really enjoyed, for example the size and shape of the remote, and some people would like the buttons to have labels while some liked the symbols; Also I learned just how useful the data from a usability study is, from this data we are able to see exactly what participants liked and didn’t like so it can be improved for the next generation of remote. Finally I learned how to undertake a study with a method I was not familiar with and apply it to a real world scenario and also undertake research within a team and understand the everyone interprets different body languages differently. </p>
    <p class="pageText">I have taken this knowledge I have gained already into my academic career. For my Research & Development project I am in a team that is developing a smartphone application, following the end of development the client wanted us to conduct some “field testing” with our friends and family so that we could make recommendations for the next team to work on it. I decided to suggest to the team we follow the method of a usability study with our friends and family on our Smartphone Application, this was the first-time ordinary people were seeing our piece of software outside of the team, client, and mentors and I felt like following the same format of an exploratory method would give us a great insight into how people feel about our software.  The knowledge I gained from conducting the exploratory usability study on the Apple Tv remote was beneficial to me as I knew how to set up a test, how to take notes and how to process the data I was recording. I found out things through this usability testing I had not even thought of. Therefore I believe that usability testing even though it can be tedious should become standard practice because getting the average populations insight on a piece of hardware/software can greatly benefit the development of these products.  </p>
