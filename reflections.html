    <p class="pageText">For my team’s usability evaluation we decided to do a usability study of an Apple TV remote. We wanted to study this remote as some of us owned one and we had heard there were some issues with it. We conducted the study using an exploratory style, where we let the user interact with the device freely. We didn’t want to influence the participant’s interaction or opinion on the device as we just wanted to discover any issues with usability. We followed Carter’s methodology of just letting the user use the device with no instruction to see how they might interact with it in the real world and get realistic usability feedback. I have done usability studies before as a part of my studies during a Digital Design diploma but previously I would give user’s specific tasks to complete. I think giving the users some tasks to complete does have some value when you want to test specific parts of a system or device but using an exploratory unstructured style of study allows the user to test the usability of something in a way that is realistic for them. It allowed us to find issues that we might not have thought about, like the issue of the TV icon (menu) button being confusing. If we had asked the users to just use the remote to find a TV show and watch it we might not have noticed that the TV icon is an issue as this button is not really related to watching TV shows.</p>
    <p class="pageText">We all had an equal role in the study as we decided to all take observations during the study so that we could compare and contrast our notes to make sure that all the issues were discovered. One person could notice an issue that others didn’t for example if they had a better view of the participant’s hand on the remote or if they are better at reading emotions. To conduct the study we briefly explained to the participant that they would use the device for five minutes and we would be watching and taking notes. Then we got the participant to sign the consent form, set a timer and told them to start using the device.</p>
    <p class="pageText">This usability study will impact my thinking and process when creating products in the future. I am completing a Bachelor of Computer Science majoring in Software Development. In my future career I will be working on software applications that will be used by many different users. Although it is unlikely I will have to conduct a usability study again, I may receive the results of a study like this so that I can implement changes to a software. From this usability study and also this Applied Human Computer Interaction paper I have learnt that you need to consider many different aspects when looking at the usability of a device or software including the culture, age and ability of a user, the environment they will use it in and what tasks they would want to complete with it. Developers often forget to think from a user perspective when creating a product which results in a product that is not very usable. Usability is an important but overlooked part of the software industry as even if a software is really well coded and provides very useful features, if it is not usable then people will not want to use it. Usability can directly impact the success of a product and impact the number of active users, the satisfaction of users and profits.</p>
