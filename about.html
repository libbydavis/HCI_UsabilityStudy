            <h4>Reasons for conducting this study</h4>
            <p class="pageText">The Apple TV Remote from the Apple TV 4k (2nd generation) is known by Apple as the Siri Remote (2nd generation). There have been four different iterations of the Apple TV Remote since the initial release of the Apple TV in 2007. The reviews for the latest design are favourable compared to previous models; however, negative feedback still exists about the remote’s usability issues. The underlying usability issues since the initial design of the remote appear to be consistent and ignored by Apple’s research and development team. Our team decided to complete a usability study focusing primarily on the Apple TV Remote (2nd Generation - Siri Remote) as the remote has undergone many design changes throughout the four different iterations. Random participants were chosen to participate who had never interacted with an Apple TV before with only their age taken into consideration to build an age demographic.</p>
            <h4>Goals of Study</h4>
            <p class="pageText">The goal of the study is to discover the critical pain points of using the Apple TV Remote across the surveyed group of random participants and review if the age and previous experience of a participant contribute to the ease of understanding an unfamiliar product. Then provide a summarised conclusion of the following issues and some recommendations for improving the product’s usability.
