      <ol>
        <p class="pageText">
          These recommendations are for changes which we feel should be
          considered for the next generation of Apple TV remote. These
          recommendations are based on our findings collected in exploratory
          usability of the Apple remote with 9 random participants ranging from
          ages 19-49. We feel these recommendations would greatly enhance the
          usability of the Apple TV remote and have categorised them from
          critical (most recommended to resolve) to low (recommended but not a
          hindrance to the user).
        </p>
        <h4>Critical</h4>
        <li class="pageText listMargin">
          <b>Improve typing ability on the Apple TV remote:</b>
          Typing via the Apple TV remote is a long-drawn-out process which is a
          visible pain point for participants which should be resolved right
          away as it impedes users from completing tasks. The team feels that
          changing the keyboard UI would be the best solution. The current UI
          has letters and numbers in descending order and has no wrap-around
          ability meaning users need to move back and forth along the line. By
          switching to a standard keyboard which most people are used to, it
          potentially could take users less time in finding characters and
          typing.

        <li class="pageText listMargin">
          <b>Update UI icons used on remote to indicate functions:</b>
          The Apple TV remote features several UI icons to indicate what is the
          function of these buttons to users. These UI icons were not always
          easily understood by users and left many confused as to what the
          button did, leaving them to not use the button feature all together
          during their exploring time. The most common of these was the home
          button which upon initial interaction participants weren’t sure what
          it was supposed to mean at all. Another UI icons which left confusion
          and resulted in participants to not use it were the volume minus and
          plus UI icons. A few participants commented that they thought the
          volume controls were to change the channels and not to control volume.
          The team feels more meaningful UI icons will help to bring clarity to
          users and increase user experience especially on the main menu button
          which could be something like a home or classic hamburger UI icon,
          which are commonly more associated with the main menu. The team also
          recommends using volume icons that better reflect the classic volume
          controls which are found on Apple products.

          <b>Ergonomic remote design:</b> Many users made remarks on the remote
          being uncomfortable due to the overall size and structure of the
          remote. The team recommends that the overall shape of the remote be
          made to be more ergonomic and fitting to the human hand. By adjusting
          the remote to an ergonomic design button placement can also be easily
          adjusted too, with frequently used buttons being placed closer to the
          right side of the remote. This is recommended as most people use their
          thumbs to navigate, and as most of the population is right-handed,
          putting these buttons towards the right would accommodate more users
          with the aim to improve and speed up user experience. The below image
          is an example of an ergonomic remote shape which we recommend.

        </h6>
        <h4>Medium</h4>
        <li class="pageText listMargin">
          <b>Button placement on voice control:</b> It is recommended that the
          voice control feature button placement should be placed on the front
          of the remote instead of on the side to help users see the feature.
          Most users were unaware of the voice control feature as the buttons
          are hidden on the side which lead to the feature not being utilised.
          As a result of being hidden when users accidently hit the button, they
          become aggravated and frustrated which could lead them to not wanting
          to use the feature later. By placing the feature button on the front
          of the remote users will be able to see it more clearly resulting in
          them using it more often and not being frustrated through accidental
          touching of it.
        </li>
        <h4>Low</h4>
        <li class="pageText listMargin">
          <b>Re-examine need for swipe feature:</b>The Apple TV remote provides
          both tactical touch and swipe ability via the circular dial buttons.
          It was found that many users did not recognize these buttons' ability
          to use swipe and instead would use the tactical touch ability more
          often. It is recommended that the swipe ability either be more
          apparent to the user by making the section look more like a swipe
          surface. Another recommendation the team has would be to remove the
          swipe ability as it was not commonly used, and it appears users favour
          tactile touch leading to questioning if the feature is needed. Overall
          the feature does not hinder the user though as all users were able to
          use the feature but some choose to purposely not use it.
