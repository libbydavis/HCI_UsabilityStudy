                <h4>Critical</h4>
                <li class="pageText listMargin">Entering a username and password with the remote was time consuming and annoying for users.
                    4/9 of participants (44%) made negative comments about the remote including ‘It is a bit fiddly’, ‘It feels slow’, ‘It’s annoying’ and ‘It takes really long to move around’. Entering the username and password into an app was the longest activity that the participant completed for every participant.
                    The participants all used the circle with arrows button at the top to navigate an onscreen keyboard for login. This requires them to click or swipe to each individual letter or number and select it. The main issue for users is the amount of time it takes and this in turn makes it annoying. To solve the amount of time it takes to log in, the remote could have a physical keyboard as then each letter has its own button and this gets rid of the need to click across to each letter.
                </li>
                <li class="pageText listMargin">The TV icon button did not have a clear purpose which made users not want to use it.
                    6/9 of participants (66%) did not use the TV icon button at all. Multiple participants made comments about how they didn’t know what this button was for. Even participants who figured out that this button is like a ‘menu’ or ‘home’ button still favoured the back button which can be used to navigate back to the home screen. Users that did use the TV icon button said that they had used a similar remote before so they used their previous knowledge to figure out what this button was for. The button doesn’t seem necessary as users prefer the back button for navigation. If the button is kept on the remote, the icon should be changed to something more meaningful to the user, like a home icon since some participants referred to the button as a ‘home’ button.
                </li>
                <h4>High</h4>
                <li class="pageText listMargin">Some users find the remote uncomfortable to hold due to the overall shape and size of the device.
                    5/9 of participants (55%) made negative comments about the size, shape or comfort of holding the device. Users made comments about the device being too small, too narrow and one user found the space at the bottom of the remote with the buttons being at the top annoying as they had to reach their thumb up to click the buttons.
                    All the participants mostly used the circle with arrow buttons and back button with their thumb to interact with the device and these are at the top of the remote. This means if the user holds the remote at the bottom they have to reach their thumb up or if they hold the remote closer to the buttons then the space at the bottom doesn’t provide any function.
                    The remote could be made slightly bigger overall, slightly wider and reduce the empty space at the bottom. These changes should only be small as some users also commented on the sleekness of the design and the remote still needs to be kept somewhat narrow and small so users can keep using their thumb to press the buttons. Increasing the measurements too much might force the user to use the remote in a different, less efficient way.
                </li>
                <h4>Medium</h4>
                <li class="pageText listMargin">Voice control is not utilised by most users due to not seeing the button or not wanting to use it.
                    7/9 of participants (77%) didn’t use voice control activated by a microphone button on the side. Out of the users that didn’t use the voice control, most of them didn’t realise there was a microphone button on the side. Users that did see the button made comments such as ‘Why is there a microphone button on the side’ and ‘Can you speak into it?...It is hidden but it’s cool’. One user said they didn’t want to use the microphone and they forgot about it and another was annoyed that they accidentally hit the button when they didn’t mean to. Users are able to navigate without voice control so it doesn’t seem absolutely necessary to include this. If it was to stay on the remote it should be made more visible by putting the button on the same side as all the other buttons or by making the button a contrasting colour to the rest of the remote so it stands out (the button is currently silver and the remote is silver).
                </li>
                <h4>Low</h4>
                <li class="pageText listMargin">The swipe feature on the circle button is not immediately clear.
                    3/9 of participants (33%) either did not use the swipe feature or didn’t realise that you could swipe at first. This is not a major issue as most participants figured out that you could swipe with this button and if they didn’t want to use this feature, they could use the arrow buttons around the circle. To make this feature more clear, a different colour, texture or any visual difference could be added as at the moment it is the same style as all the other buttons (black, smooth texture, dips in a bit).
                </li>
                <li class="pageText listMargin">Users favoured the circle with arrows buttons over all the other buttons.
                    All of the participants favoured using the circle with arrows buttons and the back button for most of the study. These buttons were used for multiple different purposes including navigating between apps, playing and pausing and fast-forwarding a programme. Participants tended to use the circle button to play and pause instead of the play/pause button. Some users did change the volume with the +/- button and muted with the mute button and all the users but one used the power button at the top to turn the TV on and off. This favouring of buttons suggests that some of the buttons are not necessary. Perhaps the play/pause button could be removed as the circle button can already do the same function.
                </li>
                <li class="pageText listMargin">It is not clear whether you need to point the remote at the TV or not.
                    A small number of participants commented on how they were confused about whether they should point the remote at the TV. One said that they thought it used infrared as the top of the remote was black. Most participants figured out that you don’t need to point the remote directly at the TV. The remote actually uses wifi and infrared to communicate with the TV. It could add more clarity if the remote had an icon at the top to show the types of communication it uses. For example add the universal wifi icon. This issue is very low priority as the remote works whether you point it at the TV or not and doesn’t negatively impact the user being able to interact with the Apple TV.
