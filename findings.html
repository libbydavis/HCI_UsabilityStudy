        <h4>Critical</h4>
        <li class="pageText listMargin">
          Entering a username and password with the remote was time consuming
          and annoying for users. 4/9 of participants (44%) made negative
          comments about the remote including ‘It is a bit fiddly’, ‘It feels
          slow’, ‘It’s annoying’ and ‘It takes really long to move around’.
          Entering the username and password into an app was the longest
          activity that the participant completed for every participant. The
          participants all used the circle with arrows button at the top to
          navigate an onscreen keyboard for login. This requires them to click
          or swipe to each individual letter or number and select it. The main
          issue for users is the amount of time it takes and this in turn makes
          it annoying. To solve the amount of time it takes to log in, the
          remote could have a physical keyboard as then each letter has its own
          button and this gets rid of the need to click across to each letter.
        </li>
        <li class="pageText listMargin">
          The TV icon button did not have a clear purpose which made users not
          want to use it. 6/9 of participants (66%) did not use the TV icon
          button at all. Multiple participants made comments about how they
          didn’t know what this button was for. Even participants who figured
          out that this button is like a ‘menu’ or ‘home’ button still favoured
          the back button which can be used to navigate back to the home screen.
          Users that did use the TV icon button said that they had used a
          similar remote before so they used their previous knowledge to figure
          out what this button was for. The button doesn’t seem necessary as
          users prefer the back button for navigation. If the button is kept on
          the remote, the icon should be changed to something more meaningful to
          the user, like a home icon since some participants referred to the
          button as a ‘home’ button.
        </li>
        <h4>High</h4>
        <li class="pageText listMargin">
          Some users find the remote uncomfortable to hold due to the overall
          shape and size of the device. 5/9 of participants (55%) made negative
          comments about the size, shape or comfort of holding the device. Users
          made comments about the device being too small, too narrow and one
          user found the space at the bottom of the remote with the buttons
          being at the top annoying as they had to reach their thumb up to click
          the buttons. All the participants mostly used the circle with arrow
          buttons and back button with their thumb to interact with the device
          and these are at the top of the remote. This means if the user holds
          the remote at the bottom they have to reach their thumb up or if they
          hold the remote closer to the buttons then the space at the bottom
          doesn’t provide any function. The remote could be made slightly bigger
          overall, slightly wider and reduce the empty space at the bottom.
          These changes should only be small as some users also commented on the
          sleekness of the design and the remote still needs to be kept somewhat
          narrow and small so users can keep using their thumb to press the
          buttons. Increasing the measurements too much might force the user to
          use the remote in a different, less efficient way.

        <li class="pageText listMargin">
          Voice control is not utilised by most users due to not seeing the
          button or not wanting to use it. 7/9 of participants (77%) didn’t use
          voice control activated by a microphone button on the side. Out of the
          users that didn’t use the voice control, most of them didn’t realise
          there was a microphone button on the side. Users that did see the
          button made comments such as ‘Why is there a microphone button on the
          side’ and ‘Can you speak into it?...It is hidden but it’s cool’. One
          user said they didn’t want to use the microphone and they forgot about
          it and another was annoyed that they accidentally hit the button when
          they didn’t mean to. Users are able to navigate without voice control
          so it doesn’t seem absolutely necessary to include this. If it was to
          stay on the remote it should be made more visible by putting the
          button on the same side as all the other buttons or by making the
          button a contrasting colour to the rest of the remote so it stands out
          (the button is currently silver and the remote is silver).
        </li>
        <h4>Low</h4>
        <li class="pageText listMargin">
          The swipe feature on the circle button is not immediately clear. 3/9
          of participants (33%) either did not use the swipe feature or didn’t
          realise that you could swipe at first. This is not a major issue as
          most participants figured out that you could swipe with this button
          and if they didn’t want to use this feature, they could use the arrow
          buttons around the circle. To make this feature more clear, a
          different colour, texture or any visual difference could be added as
          at the moment it is the same style as all the other buttons (black,
          smooth texture, dips in a bit).
        </li>
        <li class="pageText listMargin">
          Users favoured the circle with arrows buttons over all the other
          buttons. All of the participants favoured using the circle with arrows
          buttons and the back button for most of the study. These buttons were
          used for multiple different purposes including navigating between
          apps, playing and pausing and fast-forwarding a programme.
          Participants tended to use the circle button to play and pause instead
          of the play/pause button. Some users did change the volume with the
          +/- button and muted with the mute button and all the users but one
          used the power button at the top to turn the TV on and off. This
          favouring of buttons suggests that some of the buttons are not
          necessary. Perhaps the play/pause button could be removed as the
          circle button can already do the same function.

        <li class="pageText listMargin">
          It is not clear whether you need to point the remote at the TV or not.
          A small number of participants commented on how they were confused
          about whether they should point the remote at the TV. One said that
          they thought it used infrared as the top of the remote was black. Most
          participants figured out that you don’t need to point the remote
          directly at the TV. The remote actually uses wifi and infrared to
          communicate with the TV. It could add more clarity if the remote had
          an icon at the top to show the types of communication it uses. For
          example add the universal wifi icon. This issue is very low priority
          as the remote works whether you point it at the TV or not and doesn’t
          negatively impact the user being able to interact with the Apple TV.

      <h3 class="pageHeading">Recommendations</h3>
      <ol>
        <p class="pageText">
          These recommendations are for changes which we feel should be
          considered for the next generation of Apple TV remote. These
          recommendations are based on our findings collected in exploratory
          usability of the Apple remote with 9 random participants ranging from
          ages 19-49. We feel these recommendations would greatly enhance the
          usability of the Apple TV remote and have categorised them from
          critical (most recommended to resolve) to low (recommended but not a
          hindrance to the user).
        </p>
        <h4>Critical</h4>
        <li class="pageText listMargin">
          <b>Improve typing ability on the Apple TV remote:</b>
          Typing via the Apple TV remote is a long-drawn-out process which is a
          visible pain point for participants which should be resolved right
          away as it impedes users from completing tasks. The team feels that
          changing the keyboard UI would be the best solution. The current UI
          has letters and numbers in descending order and has no wrap-around
          ability meaning users need to move back and forth along the line. By
          switching to a standard keyboard which most people are used to, it
          potentially could take users less time in finding characters and
          typing.
        </li>

        <h4>High</h4>
        <li class="pageText listMargin">
          <b>Update UI icons used on remote to indicate functions:</b>
          The Apple TV remote features several UI icons to indicate what is the
          function of these buttons to users. These UI icons were not always
          easily understood by users and left many confused as to what the
          button did, leaving them to not use the button feature all together
          during their exploring time. The most common of these was the home
          button which upon initial interaction participants weren’t sure what
          it was supposed to mean at all. Another UI icons which left confusion
          and resulted in participants to not use it were the volume minus and
          plus UI icons. A few participants commented that they thought the
          volume controls were to change the channels and not to control volume.
          The team feels more meaningful UI icons will help to bring clarity to
          users and increase user experience especially on the main menu button
          which could be something like a home or classic hamburger UI icon,
          which are commonly more associated with the main menu. The team also
          recommends using volume icons that better reflect the classic volume
          controls which are found on Apple products.
        </li>
        <li class="pageText listMargin">
          <b>Ergonomic remote design:</b> Many users made remarks on the remote
          being uncomfortable due to the overall size and structure of the
          remote. The team recommends that the overall shape of the remote be
          made to be more ergonomic and fitting to the human hand. By adjusting
          the remote to an ergonomic design button placement can also be easily
          adjusted too, with frequently used buttons being placed closer to the
          right side of the remote. This is recommended as most people use their
          thumbs to navigate, and as most of the population is right-handed,
          putting these buttons towards the right would accommodate more users
          with the aim to improve and speed up user experience. The below image
          is an example of an ergonomic remote shape.
        </li>
        <h4>Medium</h4>
        <li class="pageText listMargin">
          <b>Button placement on voice control:</b> It is recommended that the
          voice control feature button placement should be placed on the front
          of the remote instead of on the side to help users see the feature.
          Most users were unaware of the voice control feature as the buttons
          are hidden on the side which lead to the feature not being utilised.
          As a result of being hidden when users accidently hit the button, they
          become aggravated and frustrated which could lead them to not wanting
          to use the feature later. By placing the feature button on the front
          of the remote users will be able to see it more clearly resulting in
          them using it more often and not being frustrated through accidental
          touching of it.
        </li>
        <h4>Low</h4>
        <li class="pageText listMargin">
            <b>Re-examine need for swipe feature:</b>The Apple TV remote provides both tactical touch and swipe ability via the circular dial buttons. It was found that many users did not recognize these buttons' ability to use swipe and instead would use the tactical touch ability more often. It is recommended that the swipe ability either be more apparent to the user by making the section look more like a swipe surface. Another recommendation the team has would be to remove the swipe ability as it was not commonly used, and it appears users favour tactile touch leading to questioning if the feature is needed. Overall the feature does not hinder the user though as all users were able to use the feature but some choose to purposely not use it.
