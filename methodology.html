    <h3 class="pageHeading">Methodology</h3>
    <p class="pageText">We chose to undertake exploratory usability to see what can improve for the next generation of Apple TV remotes. We used the research method in MacWatters and Earnshaw's paper 'Examining Course Layouts in Blackboard: Using Eye-Tracking to Evaluate Usability in a Learning Management System' and also techniques from Carter's 'Liberating usability testing'.</p>
    <h4>Participants</h4>
    <p class="pageText">In total, we had 9 participants that were picked at random, and their ages ranged from 19 - 49, with the majority of our participants being university students in courses that are non-technical based. </p>
    <h4>Design</h4>
    <p class="pageText">Participants were to explore the User Interface of the Apple TV freely, and the researchers were to give no instructions to the participants even when they were stuck. During the study, participants openly speak their thoughts while Researchers note their actions and thoughts. In the end, if the participant had not logged into an app, they were instructed to do so.</p>
    <h4>Materials</h4>
    <p class="pageText">
        Apple Tv Box: The Apple Tv Box is the device that the only device the Apple Tv Remote interacts with, and how users interact with the user interface on the Apple Tv directly impacts their Apple Tv Remote Experience
    </p>
    <p class="pageText">
        Apple Tv Remote: This was the device we conducted the exploratory usability study with.
    </p>
    <p class="pageText">
        Note with usernames and passwords: The Apple Tvs apps would be logged out between participants
    </p>
    <h4>Instruments</h4>
    <p class="pageText">Age survey: Prior to the start of the session participants were asked to state their age for the record.
    <p class="pageText">
        Data / Notes: Each researcher took observation notes of what participants said during the study, and also noted down any specific body language or movements during the sessions.
    </p>
    <h4>Setup and Procedure</h4>
    <p class="pageText">For this Study there were 3 sessions. Each session taking about one hour to complete the data collection. Set up included a room with a door that was able to be closed. Within the room there was a TV on the wall with the participant chair at the head of the table and the researchers sitting on either side of the table. The remote was placed on the table. Participants entered the room one at a time with the door closed behind them to ensure that the next participant didn't hear what the current participant was doing so as to not give them any clues. Participants were given the participant information sheet and also given the participant consent form . They were given the note with username and passwords.  They were then instructed to use the Apple Tv remote as they normally would and speak their thoughts while they were using the remote and that researchers would not be giving any instructions. The timer was started for five minutes and during this researchers were to note down the participants actions and also any of the participants thoughts. At the end of the five minutes participants, if they had not logged into any app, were then instructed to log into the TVNZ app with the username and password. After that participants were asked to make any comments on the remote and its fit and feel in the hand. Then participants were thanked for their time and exited the room. </p>
